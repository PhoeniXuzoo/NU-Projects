# Simulation: Northwestern Caesar's academic system

## Introduction 

This project implements something along the lines of Northwestern Caesarâ€™s academic system. Students can use the system to know their current courses and transcripts, to enroll some courses which satisfies prerequisite, to withdraw their courses and to modify their personal information.

## How to use

1. Import data in mysql using project3-nudb.sql. If you use mysqlWorkbench, follow these steps. Server -> Data Import -> Import from Self-Contained file -> Choose project3-nudb.sql -> Start import. Then, restart mysqlWorkbench.
   
2. In the file Application.properties, you should change these two parameters according your mysql setting:  
spring.datasource.username= ***  
spring.datasource.password= ***

3. Using scripts in [P3-sql-script](/CE495-Introduction-to-Database-Systems-and-Data-Warehousing/db_application/P3-Sql-script/) to create triggers and stored procedures.

4. Finally, you can start this spring boot project and visit localhost:19495/login.html. If failed in this step, please try to clean dependencies and reinstall all dependencies.

## Features

 - RESTful API
